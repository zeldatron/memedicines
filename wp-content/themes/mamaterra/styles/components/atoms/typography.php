<p>Burrow under covers stick butt in face flex claws on the human's belly and purr like a lawnmower and drink water out of the faucet yet cat cat moo moo lick ears lick paws and pee in the shoe, suddenly go on wild-eyed crazy rampage. Then cats take over the world lick face hiss at owner, pee a lot, and meow repeatedly scratch at fence purrrrrr eat muffins and poutine until owner comes back attack feet scratch at fleas, meow until belly rubs, hide behind curtain when vacuum cleaner is on scratch strangers and poo on owners food. Lick face hiss at owner, pee a lot, and meow repeatedly scratch at fence purrrrrr eat muffins and poutine until owner comes back throwup on your pillow, so soft kitty warm kitty little ball of furr but shake treat bag, but all of a sudden cat goes crazy fall asleep upside-down.</p>
